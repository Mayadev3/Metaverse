Cyberdelics- To Infinity and Beyond üê±‚Äçüèç

The UI design of my Cyberdelics website is a mix between gaming and movie streaming web designs. My goal was to learn how to use Bootstrap, make the website responsive on all devices, and display a well-structured, professional, clean, and attractive layout to serve its purpose. When a user browses through the pages of my site, they will encounter a collection of identity cards that describe the superpowers of the gaming personalities they can transform into. Users can read about the adventures they would embark on upon selecting a magical location and the powerful fantasy animals they can take with them to overcome obstacles. The final page of the site includes videos of Jason Silva as he describes the psychological transformation and the effects of immersive experiences in the meta world to attract users.
